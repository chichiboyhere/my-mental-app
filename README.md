# Description of my-mental-app

The Mental Game is a multiplication game where the user gets to answer as many randomly generated multiplication problems as they can, within 60 seconds. The user is required to specify the multiplication table limit they want to play and then push the 'Enter' button. They'll receive a confirmation that says 'Table limit noted'. Next the user is expected to press the 'Start Game' button to get the game started. Once the game starts, they'll be flashed a multiplication problem within the table limit specified. The user types in the answer to the problem in the input field below and presses the 'Enter' button. If the answer entered is correct, the user scores one point, else they lose a mark. And then they are supposed to retake the failed question. This process will be repeated till 60 seconds elapses. Then the final score will be displayed on the screen along with speed of the user. 
The frontend of the app was coded in Javascript using the Read Js library. The backend(for saving and retrieving the user's scores) was done in Python using the Django web framework.
